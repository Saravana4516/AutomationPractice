@Hi
Scenario: TFSScrum_PrecomputationEngine_WSJF_IBVerification_UserStory
	Given i load the project properties file 
	And i generate a token for "DevTest" environment
#	And i verify the "inbound" details for "Story_wsjf_Multiply_0" for tool "TFS Scrum" using "flat" query whose client is "PreComputationEngine_ClientUId" and DC is "PreComputationEngine_DeliveryConstructUId_L2" for "WSJF" functionality 
#	And i verify the "inbound" details for "Story_wsjf_Negative_Int" for tool "TFS Scrum" using "flat" query whose client is "PreComputationEngine_ClientUId" and DC is "PreComputationEngine_DeliveryConstructUId_L2" for "WSJF" functionality  
	And i verify the "inbound" details for "Story_wsjf_Deno_0" for tool "TFS Scrum" using "flat" query whose client is "PreComputationEngine_ClientUId" and DC is "PreComputationEngine_DeliveryConstructUId_L2" for "WSJF" functionality  
	And i verify the "inbound" details for "Story_wsjf_Nume_0" for tool "TFS Scrum" using "flat" query whose client is "PreComputationEngine_ClientUId" and DC is "PreComputationEngine_DeliveryConstructUId_L2" for "WSJF" functionality  
	And i verify the "inbound" details for "Story_wsjf_Decimal_Tool" for tool "TFS Scrum" using "flat" query whose client is "PreComputationEngine_ClientUId" and DC is "PreComputationEngine_DeliveryConstructUId_L2" for "WSJF" functionality  
	And i verify the "inbound" details for "Story_wsjf_Zero_Tool" for tool "TFS Scrum" using "flat" query whose client is "PreComputationEngine_ClientUId" and DC is "PreComputationEngine_DeliveryConstructUId_L2" for "WSJF" functionality  
	And i verify the "inbound" details for "Story_wsjf_Decimal_Output" for tool "TFS Scrum" using "flat" query whose client is "PreComputationEngine_ClientUId" and DC is "PreComputationEngine_DeliveryConstructUId_L2" for "WSJF" functionality
