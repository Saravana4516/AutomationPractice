Scenario Outline: TFSAgile_AutoRecon_ReleaseAndSprintCreationForAutoReconFromTool 
	Given i load the project properties file
	Given i login to application "<applicationname>"
    Then i select a Project for "<applicationname>"
	 And i create "<Release>" and "<Sprint>" in TFS
	 And i create a "<Story>" in TFS
	 And i create a "<Action>" in TFS
    And i update the WorkItemExternalIDs into a JSON file for "<applicationname>"
	And i put a explicit wait of "900000" 
	And i generate a token for "DevTest" environment 
	
	    Examples: 
      | applicationname | Story    | Action| Release    | Sprint    |
      | TFS             | Story_DelFunctionality |Action_DelFunctionality| Release_02 | Sprint_02 |
