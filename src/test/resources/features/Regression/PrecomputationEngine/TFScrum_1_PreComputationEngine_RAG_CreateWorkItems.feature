Scenario Outline: TFSScrum_WorkitemCreation_PreCompuation 
#	Given i load the project properties file 
	Given i login to application "<applicationname>" 
	Then i select a Project for "<applicationname>"
#	#Rule1,2,3 
#	And i "create" a "Story_RAG_StatusDone_Rule1" in TFS for "PreComputation_RAG"

#	And i "create" a "Story_RAG_NoAssociation_Rule3" in TFS for "PreComputation_RAG"
#	And i update the WorkItemExternalIDs into a JSON file for "<applicationname>" for functionality "PreComputation_RAG"	
#	#Rule4
#	And i create a "Release" with start date as "-60" days from today and end date as "1" days from today in TFS 
#	And i create a "Sprint" with start date as "-30" days from today and end date as "1" days from today in TFS

#	And i create a "Sprint" with start date as "2" days from today and end date as "14" days from today in TFS
#	And i "create" a "Story_RAG_AssociatedToStory_Rule7" in TFS for "PreComputation_RAG"
#	And i update the WorkItemExternalIDs into a JSON file for "<applicationname>" for functionality "PreComputation_RAG"	
#	And i associate "Story_RAG_AssociatedIterationTiming_Rule7" to "Story_RAG_AssociatedToStory_Rule7" with relationship "Parent" for functionality "RAG" in TFS 
	
	#Rule10
	And i "create" a "Risk_RAG_ToBeAssociatedToStory_Rule10" in TFS for "PreComputation_RAG"
	And i create a "Release" with start date as "1" days from today and end date as "60" days from today in TFS

	And i update the WorkItemExternalIDs into a JSON file for "<applicationname>" for functionality "PreComputation_RAG"	
	And i associate "Story_RAG_PastIteration_Rule10" to "Risk_RAG_ToBeAssociatedToStory_Rule10" with relationship "Related" for functionality "RAG" in TFS
	
	#Rule11
	And i "create" a "Risk_RAG_ToBeAssociatedToStory_Rule11" in TFS for "PreComputation_RAG"
	And i create a "Release" with start date as "1" days from today and end date as "60" days from today in TFS

	And i update the WorkItemExternalIDs into a JSON file for "<applicationname>" for functionality "PreComputation_RAG"
#	And i put a explicit wait of "900000"
