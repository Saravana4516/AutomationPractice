@1WorkItemCreation_TFSAgile_DeleteFunctionality		
Scenario Outline: TFSAgile_WorkitemCreation 
	Given i load the project properties file
	Given i login to application "<applicationname>"
    Then i select a Project for "<applicationname>"
    And i create a "<bug>" in TFS
    And i create a "<Epic>" in TFS
    And i create a "<Feature>" in TFS
    And i create a "<Issue>" in TFS
    And i create a "<Task>" in TFS
    And i create a "<TestCase>" in TFS
 	And i create a "<Risk>" in TFS

        And i create a "<WorkRequest>" in TFS
#     And i create a "<TestResult>" in TFS
  
 And i create "<Release>" and "<Sprint>" in TFS
    And i update the WorkItemExternalIDs into a JSON file for "<applicationname>"
	And i put a explicit wait of "900000" 
	And i generate a token for "DevTest" environment
