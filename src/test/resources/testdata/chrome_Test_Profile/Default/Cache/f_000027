Many of these businesses are struggling to stay afloat due to challenges brought by COVID-19. But there are key opportunities that SMEs can seize to remain resilient in this new reality, some of which were highlighted in a survey we conducted in collaboration with UOB and Dun &amp; Bradstreet, two of our key ecosystem partners in Financial Services. According to our research, 76 percent of these businesses commit to spend on software and IT services. We found that SMEs have turned their focus on accelerating digital transformation to weather future disruptions more effectively. This presents a significant opportunity for us to help clients in one of our key market units to explore tech-driven solutions that can propel their business forward. How? Take Cloud for example. If a client wants to quickly anticipate and address cash flow challenges, cloud-based solutions can enable SMEs to integrate services such as sales, accounting and expenses for a holistic view of operations. To learn more about the key trends and opportunities in the region, read the blog post \"A shift in focus for ASEAN SMEs in the New Normal\" by Managing Director for Financial Services in Southeast Asia Geoffroy Descamps.

Positive stress, like when we’re working hard on a passion project and near the finish line, can actually boost performance and increase energy. Negative stress, on the other hand, can have the opposite effect — draining our energy, impacting our productivity and even affecting our personal relationships. We all experience negative thought patterns or emotions from time to time, and that’s completely normal. It’s critical that we recognize those patterns so we can take steps to better manage our stress before we become stuck in a negative loop. Know your stress signals Using cutting-edge research from Stanford Medicine, Thriving Mind explores eight different ways that negative stress expresses itself — called biotypes. Understanding your biotype can help you identify your own personal signs of stress and empower you to take meaningful action in your everyday life. What are the eight biotypes? Rumination Rumination is characterized by overanalyzing situations, constant worrying and dwelling on negative thoughts, which can result in feeling paralyzed and worthless. Threat Response After facing a threat-related event, our brain returns back to its usual baseline. But when you’re in an extreme form of fight or flight, you may find yourself stuck in alarm mode and unable to recover. Negative Bias Our brain is naturally wired to react more quickly to negative information than to positive, but typically, our brain resolves those negative reactions right away. Negative Bias happens when the negative reactions persist and are reinforced through behaviors like negative self-talk, seeking constant reassurance, or apologizing excessively. Anxious Avoidance People who identify with Anxious Avoidance may exhibit distressed behavior, avoid social situations, spend more time alone, and may have a severe aversion to changes around them. Cognitive Fog Going through a period of constant stress can leave our brain feeling foggy, rather than sharp. People who identify with this biotype may have difficulty articulating thoughts or language, or experience forgetfulness. It can be hard to execute decisions, plan ahead, and implement tasks at work and home. Inattention With Inattention, your capacity to sustain focus and attention over time is disrupted. Basic functions at work and home may feel extremely difficult or impossible, and it can be exhausting to force yourself to concentrate on the task at hand. Emotional Numbness People who identify with this biotype may not be able to find pleasure in the things they normally enjoy. They may feel empty, have a hard time identifying purpose, or feel like they’re going through the motions. Some people with this biotype may turn to food or alcohol in an attempt to feel any emotion at all. Context Insensitivity Context Insensitivity is a form of Emotional Numbness, where the brain loses the capacity to find one thing more motivating or important than the other. When Context Insensitivity develops, the brain is on the verge of complete burnout and people may find it hard to function at work or in relationships. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Start the Thriving Mind course to learn more about biotypes and the recharge strategies you can adopt to calm better manage your negative stress.   Available resources Employee Assistance Programs are available in 100% of our operating countries, free of charge to all employees.

They offer voice, video, data and Internet telecommunications and professional services to businesses, consumers and government agencies. Challenge The client wanted to speed up time-to-market with a digital platform that helps retail, online sales, and services channels deliver effortless digital interactions. The client also needed a skilled and experienced team to manage the platform. Solution Accenture took over in enhancing and managing the client’s digital platform to streamline sales and services delivery. The platform employs modern eCommerce architecture required for web-scale operations and powered by microservices. We formed a shared team to manage the platform and provide DevOps as-a-service to multiple development teams. The shared team is responsible for building and developing environments, providing access, and ensuring these environments are always up and running. The team also deploys more than 200 microservices in a week across various production and non-production compute platforms. These services cover multistage pipelines—including building, testing and deploying new additions to the platform as well as running security tests. Plus, they take charge in troubleshooting and supporting various real-time issues related to application and infrastructure. Then, we launched the DevOps Dojo Model to train and upskill the team in handling various digital and automation tools such as Kubernetes, Docker and Kafka. We conducted short iteration-based learning cycles and hands-on activities across 12 hyper sprints, with 2.5 days per sprint, covering five squads with 30 participants in six weeks. With these sessions, we enhanced the technical agility and capability of the team to manage the client’s platform at speed and scale. Results By enhancing the digital platform and implementing our DevOps Dojo initiative, we helped: Improve overall productivity by 35 percent for the client. Reduce microservices deployment time by 33 percent. Cut resolution time for Kubernetes issues by 37 percent. Decrease analysis time for Kubernetes alerts by 50 percent.

The company has five divisions: Retail, HORECA supplies, Industry (processed food), Service Trade (convenience stores) and Flowers. Challenge The client faced the following challenges: Poor customer experience The client encountered high turnaround time for the distribution of fruits, vegetables and flowers due to manual system testing, which also led to unreliable and error-prone business critical applications. Delayed time-to-market Manual deployment processes increased risks for potential delays in inbound operations such as procurement, cross docking and shipment of fruits and vegetables from supplier to client warehouse. Outbound operations also faced delays due to error-prone activities for shipping goods from the warehouse to consumers. Lack of ticket insights The client needed an analytic reporting tool to diagnose recurring issues and predict future inflow of incidents. Manual creation of essential dashboards also made monthly service reporting a cumbersome task. Solution Accenture has been providing application maintenance support for the client through the Microsoft Dynamics AX2012 ERP solution, including WAX for advanced warehouse management and TRAX for transportation management modules. To help the client address operational challenges, we used our automation and data science expertise to: Develop automated scripts using Avanade Software and Cloud Services (SCS) automation framework built with Coded UI for performing smoke testing. For executing scripts, we can either use Microsoft Test management (MTM) or BAT (batch) files using Task scheduler. These scripts run every day across three pre-production environments. The client achieved 99 percent automation through scheduled jobs. Create an automated build and deployment solution using PowerShell, which is configured as a task-in-task scheduler without dependency on the Release Manager. It helped accelerate the shipment process. The PowerShell scripts, assisted by Azure scheduler, also helped achieve 98 percent automation. Leverage myWizard Virtual Data Scientist (VDS) tool for effective analysis of incidents and problem reports. Real-time graphs in VDS provide accurate status of incident reporting. The tool’s graph export feature has also eased the dashboard preparation. Results With our automation and myWizard VDS solution, we helped the client: Reduce efforts in deployment processes by approximately 52 percent using custom automation scripts and save approximately US$5,120. Lessen dependency on Release Manager by approximately 98 percent using our automated deployment solution. As such, we eliminated the business risks associated with product deployment. Improve insights and enhance stakeholder reporting using the VDS tool, leading to 33 percent saved effort and translating to US$170.6 in cost savings. Achieve approximately US$11K and 500 hours overall savings in FY20. Testimonials “This is very good.

To achieve this, on September 8, Salesforce and Accenture kicked off the ‘Taste of Success Week’ in Gallia. During this week we jump-started FY21 with a 4-day program packed with valuable sessions - plenary and industry specific virtual sessions, containing valuable content for all CALs, TSL, Sr. Managers, Managers and other members of the Account Teams across Gallia.  The focus on the first day, was on how Salesforce creates business value to our clients, the following days contained industry-specific break-out sessions with some deep-dives into how clients and their client teams are already doing this. So how does success taste? Judging by the more than 425+ attendees from Accenture Gallia that took part of this first edition: sweet. Ever so sweet. During the industry specific breakout sessions, Accenture colleagues from all over Europe, the Gallia Salesforce Business Groups and Salesforce presented compelling value propositions, client cases like Heineken, Generali, Vodafone, La Poste, and more industry specific solutions. Great feedback on the spot, lots of interaction and even some potential opportunities! We know the participants got inspired, maybe even a little surprised by the differentiating value propositions, that Salesforce is much more than CRM and the accelerated learning curve on how to become successful with the Salesforce platform and ecosystem. And once you taste success, you want more…. We are working hard on the next initiatives related to Taste of Success, so stay tuned!

But for Darianne Darjuan, App/Cloud Support Associate, being able to fully participate in a meeting is a welcome change. “I sometimes find it hard to keep up in meetings, especially if someone is talking fast, because of my hearing disability,” she explains. But with the establishment of our Accessibility Center in the Philippines, Darianne is one of 600+ employees who now has best-fit assistive technologies at their disposal. The center, meant to drive inclusion in the workplace, allows her to perform to her potential with a little digital help. Accenture Labs developed a solution called Dhvani, which means “sound” in Hindi. Here, artificial intelligence (AI) translates spoken words into text in real time. Using Microsoft Cognitive Services,  the solution allows people with hearing and speech impairments to participate in video calls, listen to webcasts and converse with coworkers. “I am thankful I am able to use Dhvani,” says Darianne. “This helps me keep up in meetings. I can now take calls, provide input, and understand what other people are saying.” The center is filled with similar solutions meant to help employees with disabilities, like Drishti, an AI-powered solution to help visually impaired people. Drishti means “vision” in Sanskrit; it uses smartphones to describe the environment around a visually impaired person, using: image recognition natural language processing natural language generation The ripple effect We’ve also been able to provide more than 4,100 team members with disability-prevention technologies like blue-light-filter glasses and anti-fatigue mats, creating a base model for the entire process to be replicated at Accenture locations worldwide. It’s working. In December, 2019, we launched similar centers in China, India, Japan and Malaysia. And we’re helping 17 additional countries do the same. “There’s no secret to creating accessibility and inclusion,” says Rudy Guiao, Accessibility Center lead and Infrastructure Services lead for ASEAN/Greater China. “It’s entirely possible when you are focused on the goal. But this project reflects the passion and purpose of our Infrastructure Services team. Intent on creating a barrier-free workplace, we have a dedicated team responsible for continuous research and development of assistive technology offerings. All of our Accessibility Center architects continually learn and upskill to keep the team relevant in this space.” “An innovation for a greater purpose” Inside of Accenture, the team’s work has been recognized with a Greater Than Award, but its positive impact extends outside of Accenture also. Several clients, including Google, Microsoft, Newmont and Sensis, are considering opening accessibility centers after seeing our positive results. “Creating the disability center was an eye opener,” says Paul Paglinawan, network operations engineer. “A key realization for all of us was that persons with disabilities all have different and unique needs, so we had to keep discovering and offering a wide range of solutions. For example, one kind of headset was not suitable for all hearing  impairments.” Rudy says the team appreciates that winning a Greater Than Award means more people at Accenture will be aware of the possibilities for people with disabilities. “Aside from the global recognition, GTA opens a bigger platform for our advocacy to be promoted and adapted by all of Accenture. It’s humanizing technology translated to an innovation for a greater purpose.” That greater purpose spans the globe. More than one billion people live with some form of disability. That’s one in seven of us. And 80% of them acquire their disability during their working years, between the ages of 18 and 64. As a result, they are 50% more likely to be unemployed. We’ve put a dent in that statistic with our accessibility centers. And with Accenture operations in 17 more countries looking to be more progressive in this area, we hope to see that 50% decrease at an increasing rate. Not only is that good for our people, it’s good for our business. Our Getting to Equal: The Disability Inclusion Advantage research shows that more inclusive companies are twice as likely to have higher total shareholder returns than their peers, on average. Plus, companies that have become more inclusive over time are four times more likely to have total shareholder returns that outperform those of their peer group. When it comes to profitability and value creation, these companies achieved 28% higher revenue, double the net income and 30% higher economic profit margins over the four-year period we analyzed, on average. Kudos to the team Congrats to the entire Accessibility Center Team for their hard work, passion and purpose. It certainly shows in the final result.

Accenture","article_id":"2402340","post_title":"We’re helping Joe Depa keep a promise to his daughter","post_content_stripped":"Raising funds for cancer research and counseling families of a child battling cancer is all part of a promise Joe Depa made to his three-year-old daughter Melissa, who died from leukemia five years ago — and one that the Accenture Applied Intelligence team is helping him keep. “When I learned that Melissa was going to pass away, I told her I was sorry that I couldn’t stop it from happening, but I made a promise that I was going to keep fighting for her and other children,” Joe says. He and his wife Erika continue to make good on that promise, raising more than $700,000 for cancer causes since 2015 through United for a Cure, which they founded in Melissa’s memory. And every year on Melissa's birthday they and their two sons collect and donate 1,000 toys to the hospital. Joe also serves on the board of directors of Cure Childhood Cancer, an Atlanta-based nonprofit organization, and is a trained mentor for families of children with cancer in association with St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital. “Research shows that unless you have walked in the shoes of a parent who has lost a child, it is very hard to relate,” Joe says. “My heart is scarred and that will never go away. But every time I’m able to help people through their pain it’s like a band-aid for the soul.” What Joe learned from that tragedy has affected the work he does in Accenture. “This experience really changed me as leader,” he says. “I have become more compassionate, as everyone has something they are going through in life. It is important to be there for each other and realize we are all in this together.” Accenture helps with data and analytics Accenture was affected too. When our leaders in the United States learned of Joe’s tireless efforts, we joined his cancer research cause. Our contribution is a data and analytics approach, developed in collaboration with researchers and clinicians from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Fred Hutch), one of the largest pediatric cancer centers in the world, and the Target Pediatric AML computational working group, a large-scale research project that supplied the data. Developed by our data scientists, the approach aims to help pediatric oncology physicians and researchers better analyze patient genetic data to potentially advance precision medicine. “When Joe asked our Applied Intelligence team to be a part of his quest to find a cure for childhood cancer, it was an enthusiastic yes,” says Jimmy Etheredge, chief executive officer for North America. “By helping Joe keep his promise to Melissa, we are also making good on our company’s mission to improve the way the world works and lives. All of Accenture can be proud of the work we’ve done — and we thank Joe and his family for all they’ve done in their daughter’s name.” Joe, Applied Intelligence lead for the U.S. South Market Unit, says that our data scientists who worked with Fred Hutch had the clinical and genomic background knowledge to hit the ground running and truly make a difference. He notes that treatment of leukemia is not a one-size-fits-all approach, as cures usually involve using a variety of different medications and treatments and most patients respond differently. “The good news is that treatments are advancing, and our company is at the forefront of the effort,” Joe says. “I’m hopeful there will be a cure for leukemia and childhood cancer in our lifetime.” Photo caption: Joe with Melissa and mom Erika.

And every year on Melissa's birthday they and their two sons collect and donate 1,000 toys to the hospital.\r\n\r\nJoe also serves on the board of directors of <a href=\"https://curechildhoodcancer.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cure Childhood Cancer</a>, an Atlanta-based nonprofit organization, and is a trained mentor for families of children with cancer in association with St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital.\r\n\r\n“Research shows that unless you have walked in the shoes of a parent who has lost a child, it is very hard to relate,” Joe says. “My heart is scarred and that will never go away. But every time I’m able to help people through their pain it’s like a band-aid for the soul.”\r\n\r\nWhat Joe learned from that tragedy has affected the work he does in Accenture.\r\n\r\n“This experience really changed me as leader,” he says. “I have become more compassionate, as everyone has something they are going through in life. It is important to be there for each other and realize we are all in this together.”\r\n<h2><strong>Accenture helps with data and analytics</strong></h2>\r\nAccenture was affected too. When our leaders in the United States learned of Joe’s tireless efforts, we joined his cancer research cause.\r\n\r\nOur contribution is a data and analytics approach, developed in collaboration with researchers and clinicians from <a href=\"https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center</a> (Fred Hutch), one of the largest pediatric cancer centers in the world, and the <a href=\"https://targetpediatricaml.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Target Pediatric AML</a> computational working group, a large-scale research project that supplied the data.\r\n\r\nDeveloped by our data scientists, the approach aims to help pediatric oncology physicians and researchers better analyze patient genetic data to potentially advance precision medicine.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-6964 alignright\" src=\"https://in.accenture.com/accenture/wp-content/uploads/sites/290/2020/09/joedepa_callout2.png\" alt=\"Callout: “Every time I’m able to help people through their pain it’s like a band-aid for the soul.”\" width=\"325\" height=\"145\" />“When Joe asked our Applied Intelligence team to be a part of his quest to find a cure for childhood cancer, it was an enthusiastic yes,” says <a href=\"https://people.accenture.com/People/user/james.o.etheredge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jimmy Etheredge</a>, chief executive officer for North America. “By helping Joe keep his promise to Melissa, we are also making good on our company’s mission to improve the way the world works and lives.

After 28 years of service and an incredible career, Olly Benzecry, who leads our United Kingdom &amp; Ireland (UKI) market unit, has decided to retire at the end of FY21. I am delighted to announce that Simon Eaves, who has been serving as our Chief Strategy Officer, will succeed Olly in leading our UKI market unit on January 1, 2021—which will allow for a smooth transition in our third largest market unit globally. Simon will continue as a member of our Global Management Committee. Olly will continue as Chairman of the UKI until the end of FY21. I also am delighted to announce that Bhaskar Ghosh, who currently serves as Advisor to the CEO, will become our Chief Strategy Officer, effective immediately, as Simon begins his transition back to the UK from his current residence in Atlanta. Olly has been a force in our business and a role model for how to develop deep leadership skills and experience. He has held global, market, industry and client account leadership roles—and in all roles has been very focused on caring for our people and serving clients. As head of UKI for nearly ten years, Olly has not only successfully led the overall business but has been deeply and personally engaged in serving our clients on their most critical transformation journeys. Earlier in his career, Olly was Chief Operating Officer for our Management Consulting and Products groups. Olly was a key contributor to developing our Next Generation Growth Model and our new purpose (which we will announce in a few weeks). He has been an important part of our Global Management Committee. Olly models his strong commitment to the community in his roles as a founding trustee and chairman of Movement to Work. He is on the board of the UK government's Inclusive Economy Partnership and an advisory board member of the Productivity Leadership Group and Innovate UK. He also sits on the Professional &amp; Business Services Council and the UK's Digital Economy Council and is a member of the Made Smarter Commission. In his role as Chairman of UKI, Olly will act as an advisor to Simon and will focus primarily on our work with our clients and client teams to pursue major, market-making transformational deals. He will also represent Accenture with key external groups. On a personal note, I want to recognize Olly’s role in my development as a leader. When I became the CEO of North America in 2015 and transitioned from being General Counsel to lead a major business unit, I asked Olly for help. Over the years, he has generously shared his advice, expertise and time with me, acting as an important sounding board. Even more important, he was inspiring to me as a leader who solved for our people, clients and Accenture; who cared deeply for his work; and who makes a difference. And since I became CEO, I have enjoyed working side-by-side with Olly at clients, including Barclays and British Telecom. I could not be happier for Olly and his family for his well-deserved retirement, but I am very glad that he will be here for FY21, continuing to make a tremendous impact at this important time. Simon brings a broad range of experience—from global, to market, sales to industry and strategy, and a track record of building deep client relationships and creating value. He also lives our Leadership Essentials in all respects. Over the last six months, in his role as Chief Strategy Officer, Simon has helped lead the rapid evolution of our industry points of view related to COVID-19 in our Now Next industry campaign. He also co-led, with corporate development, the evolution of our global Ventures &amp; Acquisitions strategy for the future, working with our Market CEOs and Growth &amp; Strategy team. He continued to work at clients, including Walgreens, AICPA, Coke, ABI and Mars. Prior to his current role, Simon was our Group Chief Executive of Products and played a pivotal role in the migration to the Next Generation Growth Model. Simon has been our Global Sales Lead of Products and Growth &amp; Strategy Lead of Products, holding these positions for several years. Simon also led our Products Customer &amp; Channel Consulting practice. He has significant experience from the UKI where he was previously Client Service Group lead for Products UKI and among many client account lead roles has been Diamond Client Account Lead for Unilever, SABMiller and Argos. Simon has lived in Atlanta since 2017, in addition to working globally in many markets around the world over the course of his career, which is essential to our strategy of bringing global to local, and local to global. He is an active participant in Accenture’s Skills to Succeed efforts and an advocate for inclusion and diversity, including being a passionate supporter of our LGBTQ Ally program. I know he is very excited to return to the UKI and take on this new role. Over the last several months, Bhaskar has been the team captain, on behalf of the Global Management Committee, of the creation of our Strategy 2025, which we will share more about in a couple of weeks when we announce our new purpose and brand. In addition, as advisor to the CEO since March 1, Bhaskar has focused on leading our Industry X growth strategy, working with Nigel Stacey and his multi-service leadership team. Prior to his current role, during the last six years, Bhaskar was the group chief executive of Accenture Technology Services. Bhaskar was critical to helping shape and implement our Rotation to the New strategy. He had overall responsibility for our Technology business, directing strategy and investments, and leading platforms, products and global technology delivery—working closely with our Strategy, Consulting, Digital, and Security groups. Under Bhaskar’s leadership, Accenture Technology Services made outstanding progress, rapidly rotating to the New and enabling clients to lead in the New. More than 200,000 Accenture Technology people were trained around the world in New IT. Accenture also strengthened New IT offerings around data, cloud and security. At the same time, Accenture opened a groundbreaking Innovation Hub in Bengaluru with a focus on driving innovation at scale, and a network of more than 18 Liquid Studios around the world. Bhaskar has personally provided leadership to developing cutting-edge technology solutions, including: the technology automation platform myWizard; Accenture’s cloud assessment and migration platform, MyNav; and the value-led ERP implementation platform of Accenture myConcerto. As an innovator, Bhaskar has been awarded six patents in the area of software engineering and platform development. Bhaskar also is passionate about inclusion and diversity, helping lead many innovative changes, which, among other things, have helped Technology—our largest Services area—be instrumental to our current achievement of 45 percent women at Accenture. As Chief Strategy Officer, Bhaskar will be responsible for our strategy, including our investment strategy and ensuring execution of our strategy across Accenture, working with his colleagues on the Global Management Committee. He also will have management oversight for the development of all assets and offerings across Services to ensure more consistent integrated assets and multi-services offerings in the future, which is core to our new strategy. In addition, he will be responsible for Accenture Research and our Responsible Business team. He will also continue his role leading our Industry X growth strategy. Please join me in thanking and recognizing Olly for his ongoing exceptional leadership, and in congratulating Simon and Bhaskar on their new roles. I look forward to celebrating Olly and thanking him again at the end of the fiscal year!

He also lives our <a href=\"https://ts.accenture.com/sites/InternalCommunicationsCenter/Communication%20Attachments/Leadership%20Essentials_FY21.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Leadership Essentials</a> in all respects. Over the last six months, in his role as Chief Strategy Officer, Simon has helped lead the rapid evolution of our industry points of view related to COVID-19 in our Now Next industry campaign. He also co-led, with corporate development, the evolution of our global Ventures &amp; Acquisitions strategy for the future, working with our Market CEOs and Growth &amp; Strategy team. He continued to work at clients, including Walgreens, AICPA, Coke, ABI and Mars.\r\n\r\nPrior to his current role, Simon was our Group Chief Executive of Products and played a pivotal role in the migration to the Next Generation Growth Model. Simon has been our Global Sales Lead of Products and Growth &amp; Strategy Lead of Products, holding these positions for several years. Simon also led our Products Customer &amp; Channel Consulting practice. He has significant experience from the UKI where he was previously Client Service Group lead for Products UKI and among many client account lead roles has been Diamond Client Account Lead for Unilever, SABMiller and Argos. Simon has lived in Atlanta since 2017, in addition to working globally in many markets around the world over the course of his career, which is essential to our strategy of bringing global to local, and local to global. He is an active participant in Accenture’s Skills to Succeed efforts and an advocate for inclusion and diversity, including being a passionate supporter of our LGBTQ Ally program. I know he is very excited to return to the UKI and take on this new role.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3695 alignright\" src=\"https://in.accenture.com/ceo/wp-content/uploads/sites/604/2020/10/Bghosh-300x287.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"287\" />Over the last several months, <strong>Bhaskar </strong>has been the team captain, on behalf of the Global Management Committee, of the creation of our Strategy 2025, which we will share more about in a couple of weeks when we announce our new purpose and brand. In addition, as advisor to the CEO since March 1, Bhaskar has focused on leading our Industry X growth strategy, working with <a href=\"https://people.accenture.com/People/user/nigel.j.stacey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Nigel Stacey</strong></a> and his multi-service leadership team.\r\n\r\nPrior to his current role, during the last six years, Bhaskar was the group chief executive of Accenture Technology Services. Bhaskar was critical to helping shape and implement our Rotation to the New strategy. He had overall responsibility for our Technology business, directing strategy and investments, and leading platforms, products and global technology delivery—working closely with our Strategy, Consulting, Digital, and Security groups.\r\n\r\nUnder Bhaskar’s leadership, Accenture Technology Services made outstanding progress, rapidly rotating to the New and enabling clients to lead in the New. More than 200,000 Accenture Technology people were trained around the world in New IT. Accenture also strengthened New IT offerings around data, cloud and security. At the same time, Accenture opened a groundbreaking Innovation Hub in Bengaluru with a focus on driving innovation at scale, and a network of more than 18 Liquid Studios around the world.\r\n\r\nBhaskar has personally provided leadership to developing cutting-edge technology solutions, including: the technology automation platform myWizard; Accenture’s cloud assessment and migration platform, MyNav; and the value-led ERP implementation platform of Accenture myConcerto. As an innovator, Bhaskar has been awarded six patents in the area of software engineering and platform development.\r\n\r\nBhaskar also is passionate about inclusion and diversity, helping lead many innovative changes, which, among other things, have helped Technology—our largest Services area—be instrumental to our current achievement of 45 percent women at Accenture.\r\n\r\nAs Chief Strategy Officer, Bhaskar will be responsible for our strategy, including our investment strategy and ensuring execution of our strategy across Accenture, working with his colleagues on the Global Management Committee. He also will have management oversight for the development of all assets and offerings across Services to ensure more consistent integrated assets and multi-services offerings in the future, which is core to our new strategy. In addition, he will be responsible for Accenture Research and our Responsible Business team. He will also continue his role leading our Industry X growth strategy.\r\n\r\nPlease join me in thanking and recognizing Olly for his ongoing exceptional leadership, and in congratulating Simon and Bhaskar on their new roles. I look forward to celebrating Olly and thanking him again at the end of the fiscal year!\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2428\" src=\"https://in.accenture.com/ceo/wp-content/uploads/sites/604/2019/07/Julie.jpg\" alt=\"Julie Sweet's signature\" width=\"77\" height=\"97\" />","post_link":"https://in.accenture.com/ceo/?site=1&blog=604&p=3689","site_url":"https://in.accenture.com/ceo/","post_thumb":"https://cdn.in.accenture.com/prod/wp-content/uploads/sites/604/2020/10/05012859/ACN_Leadership_Announcement_D1.png","post_date":"2020-10-05 11:49:38","post_modified":"2020-10-05 11:49:38","isread":"0","article_score":"0.000000","isfeatured":"0","source_short_tag":"Julie Here","category_url":"https://in.accenture.com/ceo/","source_url":"https://in.accenture.com/ceo"},{"aggregator_short_tag":"Global","aggmeta_short_tag":"Global","aggregator_siteid":"598","aggregatorunreadcount":"11","sitegrouporder":"4","sortid":"23","short_tag":"Across Accenture","article_id":"2441152","post_title":"Focus on Disability Inclusion starts at the top","post_content_stripped":"﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ George Washington had a learning disability.

Julie joined SAP CEO Christian Klein and 3M CEO Mike Roman for a conversation moderated by Executive Director and CEO of the UN Global Compact Sanda Ojiambo about moving beyond incremental progress to transformation through SDG Ambition , our joint partnership with SAP and UN Global Compact, and most recently, 3M as Patron Sponsor, to challenge and support companies in integrating the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which cover issues such as inequality, poverty, education and climate—into their core business. In introducing the session, Ojiambo noted that “the business of business is truly no longer just business,” especially today. “The next few months provide a window of opportunity for all of us to make the seemingly impossible, possible. It's a time for reinvention, a time to reset, and a time for rebuilding to shape a sustainable future,’ she said. “For the private sector, this reinvention must address the wider societal and environmental impacts of business strategy in ways that drive both business benefit and societal transformation.” Julie expanded on the point, underscoring the role of technology. “If we think about it in the context of COVID, we need to accelerate digital because we are now in a remote, contactless world,” Julie said. “This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to re-platform global business through technology and change the business of business by building sustainability into the design.” To do so, and to further accelerate business action in achieving the SDGs, the SDG Ambition program launched new guidance to provide business leaders with directional support on measuring and managing sustainability performance. Ambition Guide: Setting Goals for the Decade of Action establishes the initial set of SDG Ambition Benchmarks that challenge organizations to set more ambitious goals and targets in the areas in which business is positioned to have a substantial impact. Integration Guide: Designing Business Systems for the SDGs presents the approach through which the 10 SDG Ambition Benchmarks can be integrated into core business processes and systems to enable effective measurement and management of sustainability performance. SDG Ambition Benchmark Reference Sheets provide illustrative details regarding the steps to integrate each of these benchmarks into a company’s business systems, as well as the key design decision required to engage technology partners. Collaborating with speed and humility Julie also shared how SDG Ambition underscores the humility and speed required when it comes to organizations working together. “To me, these collaborations demonstrate that we have to be humble and we have to learn from others,” she said. “Companies, governments and NGOs all have different perspectives and are doing great things, so having the humility to say we need to come together and learn from each other will give us the speed that is so critical to creating a better future.” What’s Next &amp; Learn More Through the UN Global Compact and their Local Network teams, Accenture will be supporting the SDG Ambition Accelerator kicking off in January 2021. This program will guide 1,000+ companies, including many of our clients, in raising their sustainability ambitions and more deeply integrating the SDGs.  To learn more about the Accelerator, visit the SDG Ambition website.
